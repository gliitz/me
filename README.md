# Title: Roberts Contacts on Instagram

## Introduction

My first idea was to create a program that hopefully could inform the user which courses are more favorable and which are least favorable and when to take the courses. While writing the program, I discovered how to collect a users data from instagram like contacts, messages, profiles they liked and I thought that would be cooler to use.

### Data

Instagram has a feature which you can use to generate all your data on it. But the data is all packed together and distributed into weird zipped folders, so you would have to go through and sort it out.I was able to sort through the data and generate a folder with json files which just had the contacts, messages and likes of the user. The one I decided to use was:

- contacts.json: data with a list of contacts linked to the users file/number.

## Run

To run my program you would need [python 3] installed.

After that you should be able to run my program

    python3 project.py

This will print out a prompt in which you get to interact with the program.
It prompts you to type the first letter of the contact name you wish to search searching for. 

    "Enter the first letter of the contacts name: "
